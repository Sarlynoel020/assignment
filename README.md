# 📘 Assignment

## Goal
Validate fundamentals from today — `#!/bin/bash`, `echo/printf`, `read -r`, variables, numeric validation, `if/elif/else`, `while` + `for` loops, `sleep`, `date`, and basic menu flow.

## Task
Write a script that:
- Has a banner and comments.  
- Asks for **name**, **age**, and **city** (validate numeric age).  
- Uses one of the numeric comparison operators — for example, `-ge`.  
- Uses **if/elif/else** for decision-making.  
- Shows a **menu or list of options** and handles invalid input.  
- Simulates an order with **sleep** and prints time using **date**.  
- Wraps the flow in a **while loop** so the user can repeat or exit.  
- Ends with a closing message.

## Deliverables (Screenshots)
1️⃣ `cat your_script.sh` showing header + banner  
2️⃣ `ls -l your_script.sh` (permissions)  
3️⃣ Successful run with name, age, and choice  
4️⃣ Invalid age → error  
5️⃣ Invalid option → message  
6️⃣ While loop repeat + exit  
7️⃣ Sleep + date output
